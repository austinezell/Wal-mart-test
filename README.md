`export MONGO_URL` to environment for cloud storage
####(will default to localhost otherwise. Needs MongoDB installed and running locally if this is the case.)

Use the command `mongod` from a terminal to ensure MongoDB is running

###Built on Node.js v5.8
If you do not have node and npm install them from http://nodejs.org/

Once you have them, run `npm install` from command line to install Node packages.

`postinstall` script runs automatically to cover the rest of development procedure.
(`postinstall`: `bower i` to install bower packages, `gulp dev` to generate CSS, HTML templates, move images from **src** to **public** and populate database, and `webpack` to bundle the JavaScript.)

`npm start` will launch the server to run the application. Simply go to `localhost:3000` in your browser.

For debugging purposes there are two tests, one to determine if server connection is established,
one to test if the database contains the proper data.
`npm test` will run both tests.  *tests will pass but throw an error if server is running.*
